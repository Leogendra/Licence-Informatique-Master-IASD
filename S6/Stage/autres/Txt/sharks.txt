[Verse 1]
Trouble
Blood is in the rocky waters
Hide away your sons and daughters
Eat you alive
Levels
Better put your head on swivels
Dancin' with the very devil
Butter to knife

[Verse 2]
Bubbles
Drownin', you're seein' doubles
Don't you let them see your struggles
Hidin' your tears.
Crisis
Take avanage of your niceness
Cut you up in even slices
Prey on your fears.

[Bridge]
Every time my heart is beatin', 
I can feel the recipe
I wonder if my day is coming, 
blame it on the entropy
My blood is pumpin', 
I can see the end is right in front of me
Don't take it from me, 
I could be everything, everything

(Sharks)

Don't take it from me
My blood is pumpin', my blood is pumpin' (Sharks)
Don't take it from me, I could be everything, everything
